1. Jet Lag Rooster

	- This app seems to simply target anyone who is suffering from jet lag, which is similar to our target user group except that we are targeting a more specific group (young travelers who are inexperienced in traveling across different time zones) in order to better design an interface that is geared towards helping them understand how jet lag prevention works in addition to helping them combat the effects of jet lag. The app allows users to generate a projected sleep schedule based on their sleep habits, their current and destination location, and the date and time of their departure and arrival, and includes a function that automatically sets alarms for when the user needs to wake up. The app is successful is displaying generating a displaying an easy to understand sleep schedule to the user, but we are planning to do much more with our app, including the integration of different sleep strategies such as light control and melatonin intake, display how the user's current sleep schedule matches up to his or her intended destination's sleep schedule using a dynamic graph, and enable reminders through notifications via smartphone and smartwatch to help users adhere to their schedule.

2. Jet Lag Begone

	- The target group is essentially the same as Jet Lag Rooster, with the differences between our target user group being the same as well. In addition to the functionality in Jet Lag Rooster, this app also integrates light exposure and melatonin intake into the sleep schedule that is recommended to the user, but does not have an auto-alarm feature. The challenges with this app is that it integrates the same strategies used to combat jet lag that we are planning on using, but our app will be more flexible by allowing users to enable or disable the use of these additional strategies as they choose, in addition to improved functionality that was described in the previous example.

3. Entrain

	- Once again, the target user group is the same as the two apps mentioned previously, with the differences between our target group being the same as well. The functionality of this app differs in that it associates the presence or lack of light exposure to being awake or sleeping, and does not make the distinction in the sleep schedule that it generates. Yet, the strong point of this app is that it produces a visualization of how the user's current sleep schedule matches up to his or her intended sleep schedule, and enables the user to provide additional details such as age, sex, and frequency of travel to better tailor the recommended sleep schedule to be as effective as possible; despite having features that our app also plans on having, the lack of different sleep strategies is a clear disadvantage in terms of functionality, and the lack of notifications or alarms is a huge blow to its effectiveness.

Summary: I was able to download all three apps on my phone and play around with them, and it seems that each of the three apps covers different features that we are planning to integrate into our application. The first app has the auto-alarm fucntion that we want to integrate as part of our notification and reminder service, while the second app includes sleep strategies such as controlling light exposure and melatonin intake that we are planning on including, while the third app provides excellent visualization of how the user's current sleep cycle matches up with his or her's inteded sleep cycle and enables the user to give certain types of feedback, features that we are planning on including as well. Yet, not one of these apps has yet to include all these features, with makes our project unique in that it will bring all these features to one centralized application. Plus, none of these apps are integrated with smartwatches or have a reliable notifiction system to keep the user on track with the sleep strategies they are following, so these two additional features, on top of congregating the existing features into one app, will most definitely provide our app unique value.
