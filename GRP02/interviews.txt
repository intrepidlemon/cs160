\f0\fs24 \cf0 Target User\
The target user we selected is young, international travelers who travel frequently amongst time zones. These users ideally seek help in preparing for a change in time zone. They want to avoid any jet lag and have an easy transition into their new time zone, which may be very different than their original time zone. I have selected three users who fit this description. User 1 is a 21-year-old male who is currently working in Redwood City, California. He graduated from the University of California, Davis this past spring with a degree in Electrical Engineering. During his time in college, he studied abroad in Japan. He plays tennis and enjoys dancing. He also enjoys exploring new cities like San Francisco. User 2 is a 22-year-old female who is currently working in Lisbon, Portugal at a startup incubator. She is originally from Wisconsin and has recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee with a degree in International Business. She is a frequent traveler who has already studied abroad for extended periods of time in Europe twice prior to this trip to Portugal. She enjoys graphic design, and of course, traveling. She speaks English, Portuguese, and Spanish. User 3 is a 23-year-old male who is currently backpacking throughout Europe and Africa. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Spanish and Portuguese. He is originally from Mexico and moved to the United States just prior to starting university. He loves learning languages. He can speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, all fluently. He is very adventurous and spontaneous and has a passion for learning about other cultures.\

Contextual Inquiry\
The interview with User 1 was in person over lunch, while the interviews with User 2 and User 3 were over Skype since they are both currently abroad. Since our application is targeted for those actively traveling through time zones, I thought it would be best to simply interview the users about their experience with this. I asked about how they dealt with and how they imagined this would improve with the help of our application. Using this application does not depend on day-to-day tasks, so it eliminated the need to observe them during their work and unfortunately, none of them were actually switching time zones this week. A common aspect with all three users is that they have had experience with international travel, and thus, switching between time zones. All admit to having trouble adjusting naturally (i.e. without any planning, sleep medication, etc.) and none of them actually plan out their adjustment prior to the trip. One unique thing was that User 1 had a much different experience than User 2 and User 3. User 1\'92s destination, Japan, is west of the United States in contrast to User 2 and User 3\'92s destination which was east of the United States. In general, they agreed that it is much easier to adjust if you are traveling west. For User 1, this meant when he first got to his destination. For User 2 and User 3, this meant when they arrive back home at the end of their trip. In addition, User 1\'92s hours of adjustment were much larger than those of User 2 and User 3. User 1 had to adjust to a 16 hour time zone difference in comparison to User 2 and User 3 who had to adjust to an 8 hour time zone difference, a gap that is still significant but twice as less as User 1. Thus, I thought that this large gap and the traveling west at the start of the trip was interesting. Overall, the users were in a general consensus that a sleep lag application would be helpful in planning out the adjustment. \
