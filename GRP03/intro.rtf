\f0\fs24 \cf0 Introduction and Mission Statement\
Our mission is to provide an interesting, yet informative video that will demonstrate the purpose of our application. We hope that our video will answer any questions that the user may initially have about the functionality and usability of our application. We also aim to provide a clear demonstration of how the application may be used during an average day and how we expect the user to interact with it. In order to achieve this mission, we have divided the work amongst the four of us. Josef posed for our pictures, while Ianto edited these pictures and organized them. David wrote the script for our video and Tatiana narrated it. In addition, Ianto wrote the implementation strategy, Josef wrote the prototype description, David wrote the video prototyping description, and Tatiana wrote the introduction and mission statement.\
