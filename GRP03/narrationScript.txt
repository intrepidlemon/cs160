* This is a very rough draft of the script. I basically wrote this off a stream of consciousness, and I don't intend for anyone to take what I wrote word for word; hopefully it serves as a good starting point. Feel free to change anything (seriously, anything), to make it better.

* Time Limit: 3 Minutes
* Include three tasks - one easy, medium, and hard.
* Most show the context of how the interface will be used (backstory).

- Josef, being young and adventurous, really likes to travel.
	- Scene 0, all images, and Scene 1, images of Josef peeking his head out.
- The problem is, he has a difficult time dealing with jet lag and adjusting to the local time zones. As a result, he spends a good portion of his trip sleeping, and misses out on the chance to explore incredible locations.
	- Scene 2 img 51 through 62 of Josef walking out all tired, and then img 1 through 3 of him sleeping through Eiffel Tower, Sydeny Opera House, and Pudong
- Luckily, the sleep sentry app is here to help him. Josef can either enter in his flight information that will automatically determine his current location and intended destination... (entering information and selecting options is the easy difficulty task)
	- Scene 3, img 9 through 12
- ... or manually set those parameters himself.
	- Scene 3, img 13
- Josef will then be asked to enter information regarding his current sleep schedule...
	- Scene 3, img 14
- ... and his desired sleep schedule while abroad.
	- Scene 3, img 15
- In addition to getting his adjusted sleep schedule, Josef also has the option to explore different strategies to help him prevent jet lag, such as tracking light exposure or taking melatonin.
	- Scene 3, img 16
- Once the app has gathered all the required information, Josef will be presented with his projected sleep schedule (perhaps explain the interface a bit here?)
	- Scene 3, img 17
- Now the hard part is for Josef to actually follow his sleep schedule (Make sure its obvious this is a hard level task) Since it is not something he is used to, he is prone to be forgetful of his schedule. Luckily, the smartwatch can issue notifications to remind him that he should either be exposing himself to more or less light...
	- Scene 4, img 14 through 16
- ... getting more melatonin...
	- Scene 4, img 17 through 21
- ... or staying awake when he is about to doze off.
	- Scene 4, img 22 through 27
- Thanks to the sleep sentry app, Josef is now super energized and alert when he arrives at his destination, letting him explore all the things and take all the pictures.
	- Scene 5, img 5 through 9, then img 2 and 3
- He can also input feedback to how to the propsed sleep schedule and adjustment strategies worked out for him. The app will take his feedback into account and adjust accordingly his future trips. (Make sure the make known evaluation is the medium difficulty task)
	- Scene 5, img 0 and 1.
