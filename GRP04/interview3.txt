# Methods
The participant is a 58 year old female who often vacations in Europe and visits family in the Philippines. This participant has no experience using sleep applications. 

The testing environment was at the participant's home in Union City. Images of the interface were loaded onto a Samsung Galaxy S5. Screens were switched by swiping to the next picture. The smartwatch screens were displayed by placing the smartphone on the participant's wrist. 

# Results
The participant quickly completed the initial task of inputting flight information and sleep schedules. She continued to the select additional sleep strategies page, in which she diligently read all of the available strategies and decided she did not want to try any of them. However, the app currently forces users to select at least one strategy, so she reluctantly chose to take melatonin. The participant then viewed the graph depiction of her sleep strategy. After a minute scanning the many aspects of the graph, she stated that she did not understand the axes of the graph nor the striped area on the graph. Once given a thorough description of the grpah, she could successfully interpret the graph, but she felt it unnecessarily detailed. She suggested providing the target sleep times without a graphical interface. The participant then scrolled through a set of watch notifications, only stopping at the notification labeled "Sleep Alert" to suggest providing the user with more time than just thirty minutes to prepare for sleep. Lastly, the participant wrote a review for her sleep strategy and navigated a log of old sleep strategy reviews. She noticed that the log of reviews were listed by IATA airport codes such as SFO, JFK, or CDG. She understood the codes because she is an experienced traveler, but she felt a less traveled user may be confused by the airpot codes. She suggested explcitly writing the names of the current and destination cities in the history of reviews.

# Discussion
The sleep strategy graph needs to be revisited. Either drastic changes need to be made to the graph to make it easily interpreted by the user, or a very throrough overview of the graph needs to be provided to the user on first use. If neither of these two options work, the graph may need to be removed altogether, as suggested by the participant in this test. Also, the log of reviews needs to give information easily understood by the user, which may include replacing the current IATA airport codes with names of the current and destination cities. Also, icons indicating whether melatonin, light exposure, or neither of these strategies were used in a sleep plan may be used in the log of reviews as well. Lastly, the frequency of the watch notifications may need to be decided by the user. The app is intended to provide discreet notifications throughout the day. However, the participant in this test believes persistent notifications may be more beneficial because she can plan her day in accordance to the sleep notifications ahead of time.
