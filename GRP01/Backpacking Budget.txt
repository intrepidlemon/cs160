\f0\fs24 \cf0 The budgeting application was chosen because it is a universal product that many people, young and old, would benefit from. One of the most stressful part about traveling is money. Often money holds a lot of people back from enjoying their vacation or time abroad. By having a budgeting application, users no longer would have to worry about costs and expenditures. Therefore, we thought this would be a simple, yet useful application to expand on.\
\
Project description:\
\
Users: Our target user group would be young backpackers. Although this application can help a variety of users, it is often found that young people are in more need of money managing than those older than them who may already have the means to not be as monetarily conscious. In addition, out of young travelers, backpackers are often the ones who need to budget themselves the most since their goal is to travel around their destination cost effectively. Backpackers want to get the most out of their experience by the cheapest means possible, so they would be our ideal target group.\
\
Problems: A problem for travelers alike is that they start out with a large sum of money designated for their trip, say $1000. Throughout their time away, it is easy to fall susceptible to spending $4 on a coffee, $15 on lunch, $80 on the hotel, $20 on souvenirs, etc. until a few day into their trip, they realize they have spent a good chunk of their money. It is so easy to get caught up in spending when you know you have a large amount to spend from. However, the key to have your money last the entire duration of your trip is to budget wisely. This is a skill that many people do not possess. Backpackers especially need this skill so that they can accomplish all that they want to and not worry about having to stop their journey and make plans. Money availability can influence where a backpacker will go and what they will do, so it is an important aspect of their trip.\
\
Complementary solutions: There are many budgeting applications that already exist. My personal favorite would be Mint, a personal finance tracker created by Intuit. However, many of these scope the broad aspect of finance and not travel budgeting. For example, Mint is linked with all my bank accounts so that I can keep on eye on how much money I have in each account. It also shows me where my money is going, reminds me of bills I have to pay, etc. There is also the simple pen and paper budgeting in which a traveler may keep track of his or her finances through a daily journal.\
\
Mobile app justification: This idea would be convenient on a mobile application because it would require less work from the traveler, who is probably more focused on enjoying his or her time away than on his or her finances. Instead of having to carry a journal around, they can log their finances in a simple mobile application. This would be more convenient because backpackers prefer to travel light. Therefore, travelers would be able to have their budgeting already planned out on their phone, an item that they would already be bringing with them. A regular desktop or web application would not be viable in this case because most of them will not bring their laptops with them on their travels and will not have access to many computers.\
\
Smartwatch justification: A smartwatch would be a good solution to the problem because backpackers are always on the go! With all their traveling, it is easy to lose and misplace items. A phone could easily get lost within their giant backpack and would be very difficult to obtain when they are in need of it. In addition, amongst hostels, bars, and the many other locations backpackers explore, they could easily get their phone stolen. If they do not want it to get lost within their backpack and have their mobile phone in their pockets or outer pockets of their backpack, they are suspect to pickpocketing. A smartwatch would be readily available during their travels and always on their person, so it would be difficult to lose. It is always ready to join them on their journey.\
\
User Validation: I have talked to two people in my study abroad program. Both are currently in Lisbon  doing internships. One is a twenty year old male who just arrived about a week ago. Another is a twenty-two year old female who has been in Portugal for a month now and is going to stay for two more months. Both agree that a budgeting application would prove extremely helpful. The male user mentioned that he has had many friends who have \'93blown their money.\'94 The female user said she would use the application herself, seeing as she spent a large sum of money during her first month in Portugal and is worried she may not have enough to sustain her remaining two months. }
